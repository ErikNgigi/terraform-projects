# Terraform AWS Projects

This repository contains code and resources for learning AWS automation using Infrastructure as Code (IAC) principles with Terraform. With this project, you can quickly spin up AWS infrastructure resources and manage them efficiently using Terraform's declarative syntax.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for automating AWS infrastructure provisioning and management using Terraform. By using this repository, you will gain practical experience in:

- Setting up AWS infrastructure components such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, and more.
- Defining infrastructure configurations using Terraform's declarative language.
- Managing infrastructure changes and updates in a version-controlled manner with Git.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your local machine:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- Git

You'll also need an AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.

<!-- ## Getting Started -->

<!-- To get started with this project, follow these steps: -->

<!-- 1. Clone this repository to your local machine: -->

<!--     ```bash -->
<!--     git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-aws-automation.git -->
<!--     ``` -->

<!-- 2. Navigate to the project directory: -->

<!--     ```bash -->
<!--     cd terraform-aws-automation -->
<!--     ``` -->

<!-- 3. Configure your AWS credentials: -->

<!--     ```bash -->
<!--     aws configure -->
<!--     ``` -->

<!-- 4. Initialize Terraform: -->

<!--     ```bash -->
<!--     terraform init -->
<!--     ``` -->

<!-- 5. Review the Terraform configurations in the `main.tf` file and adjust them according to your requirements. -->

<!-- 6. Apply the Terraform configurations to create AWS resources: -->

<!--     ```bash -->
<!--     terraform apply -->
<!--     ``` -->

<!-- 7. After verifying the changes, confirm by typing `yes`. -->

<!-- 8. Once Terraform completes the provisioning process, you can access and manage your AWS resources via the AWS Management Console or CLI. -->
